        <h3>I AM SUFFERING EVERY SINGLE DAY </h3>
        <p>Whether a gift from an admirer or purchased yourself, drooping flowers and fallen petals on the floor bring a touch of sadness.
We all would like our fresh-cut flowers to last forever or at least for more than a few days. So, where do we go wrong?
“The big secret is to know the process and to keep flowers hydrated,” says Rodney Canady, event coordinator and third-generation master florist at Just Judy’s Flowers, Local Art & Gifts. 
“Most people do not change the water, allowing bacteria to grow in the water and travel up the stem about a quarter of an inch,” Canady says. “That is enough to block water from moving up the stem.”
The first step is to make sure you use a sterile, clean container, he says. Next, fill with fresh water. Freshly cut flowers have enough stored sugars to survive in a vase, but if you prefer to add a preservative, make sure your flower food consists of glucose and citric acid, which slows bacteria, Canady says.
“Most importantly, change the water every day, and give the stems a fresh cut,” he advises.
President of the Northwest Florida Florist Association, Canady also suggests purchasing fresh-cut flowers from professional retail florists, not mass marketers.
“It’s always a good idea to seek out trained professionals that are educated about the process and understand how to handle fresh flowers,” Canady says.</p>
