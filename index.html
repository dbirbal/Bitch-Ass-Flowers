        <h3>Bitch don't kill my vibe </h3>
        <p>Whether a gift from an admirer or purchased yourself, drooping flowers and fallen petals on the floor bring a touch of sadness.
We all would like our fresh-cut flowers to last forever or at least for more than a few days. So, where do we go wrong?
“The big secret is to know the process and to keep flowers hydrated,” says Rodney Canady, event coordinator and third-generation master florist at Just Judy’s Flowers, Local Art & Gifts. 
“Most people do not change the water, allowing bacteria to grow in the water and travel up the stem about a quarter of an inch,” Canady says. “That is enough to block water from moving up the stem.”
The first step is to make sure you use a sterile, clean container, he says. Next, fill with fresh water. Freshly cut flowers have enough stored sugars to survive in a vase, but if you prefer to add a preservative, make sure your flower food consists of glucose and citric acid, which slows bacteria, Canady says.
“Most importantly, change the water every day, and give the stems a fresh cut,” he advises.
President of the Northwest Florida Florist Association, Canady also suggests purchasing fresh-cut flowers from professional retail florists, not mass marketers.
“It’s always a good idea to seek out trained professionals that are educated about the process and understand how to handle fresh flowers,” Canady says.

Our friends at Escambia County Extension/University of Florida also offer some tips for preserving cut flowers:
• Re-cut the flower stems using a sharp knife or shears. Remove at least one-half inch of stem to expose a fresh surface. Stems, especially rose stems, should be re-cut under water. It is important to cut at a slant to avoid crushing the stem and to prevent a flat-cut end from resting on the bottom of the vase.
• Put flowers in water as soon as possible. Maximum water uptake occurs in the first 36 to 48 hours after cutting flowers. Place stems in 100-110°F (38-40°C) water, because warm water moves into the stem more quickly than cold water.
• Removing thorns from your roses may shorten their vase life. If damaged during the removal process, flowers may be opened up to microbes that could slow down water conducting cells.
• Make sure to remove any leaves from the stem that may be submerged. Because transpiration through leaves drives water flow up the stems of cut flowers, don’t strip all the leaves from the stem.
• Do not place flowers in direct sunlight, over a radiator, or near a television set. Heat reduces flower life since flower aging occurs more rapidly in high-temperature conditions. It is important to avoid all drafty locations because warm or moving air removes water from flowers faster than it can be absorbed through the stems.
• Keep flowers away from cigarette smoke and ripening fruit, because they contai</p>
